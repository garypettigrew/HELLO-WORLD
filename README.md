# HELLO-WORLD
Trying to learn new stuff at my age!

This is all new to me, having fun learning though. I'm installing radiant heat in my house with solar back-up. I'm trying to make a temperature differential controller using Arduino. It's slow going and I thought I could get some good ideas here on GitHub! Writing code is a whole new world to me.
